## KVASIR DATASET 
### - Multi-Class Image-Dataset for Computer-Aided Gastrointestinal Disease Detection
## Dataset Description
Automatic detection of diseases by use of computers is an important, but still unexplored field of research. Such innovations may improve medical practice and refine healthcare systems all over the world. However, datasets containing medical images are hardly available, making reproducibility and comparison of approaches almost impossible. Here, we present Kvasir, a dataset containing images from inside the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The collection of images is classified into three important anatomical landmarks and three clinically significant findings. In addition, it contains two categories of images related to endoscopic polyp removal. Sorting and annotation of the dataset are performed by medical doctors (experienced endoscopists). In this respect, Kvasir is important for research on both single- and multi-disease computer-aided detection. By providing it, we invite and enable multimedia researchers into the medical domain of detection and retrieval.

## Applications of the Dataset
Our vision is that the available data may eventually help researchers to develop systems that improve the healthcare system in the context of disease detection in videos of the GI tract. Such a system may automate video analysis and endoscopic findings detection in the esophagus, stomach, bowel, and rectum. Important results will include higher detection accuracies, reduced manual labor for medical personnel, reduced average cost, less patient discomfort and possibly increased willingness to undertake the examination. In the end, the improved screening will probably significantly reduce mortality and several luminal GI disease incidents. For direct use in multimedia research areas, the main application area of Kvasir is the automatic detection, classification, and localization of endoscopic pathological findings in an image captured in the GI tract. Thus, the provided dataset can be used in several scenarios where the aim is to develop and evaluate algorithmic analysis of images. Using the same collection of data, researchers can easily compare approaches and experimental results, and results can be reproduced. In particular, in the area of image retrieval and object detection, Kvasir will play an important initial role where the image collection can be divided into training and test sets for developments of and experiments for various image retrieval and object localization methods including search-based systems, neural-networks, video analysis, information retrieval, machine learning, object detection, deep learning, computer vision, data fusion, and big data processing.
